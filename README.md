# TossACoinTo

## Idea  

Create a simple game where the user flips a coin, if they win, they keep the coin, if they loose they loose a coin.

## Why?
This was part of an idea back in SoC that we couldn't figure out how to code and style  

## progress  
Function created to display heads or tails on click of button ✔

Set player move ✔  
Soreboard  
Decide if player wins, does selection match result - will need to pull state up higher so this can be accessed by all
